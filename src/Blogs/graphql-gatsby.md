# GraphQL and Gatsby - the perfect fit

## This might sound obvious, but there's more too it.

Gatsby does include source plugins for third-party graphql sourcing... even your own graphql server, but sometimes that isn't enough.

Gatsby is a static site generator build with React, Redux, Reach-Router, Graphql and several other libraries. So how can you use it for data rich app development.

You can still fetch api from any of the react components making up a gatsby static site, including graphql. Gatsby doesn't restrict your ability to call api from any source within the components or calling Apollo client data from a component either.

### With the rest of this tutorial I'll be going through the steps to create a quick graphql/ prisma server and use apollo client to recieve the data.
