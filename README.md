# Plan

1. Use Json file and transformer for data file as project source

- I'm doing this so that I don't need to use up one of my free contentful spaces

2. Change all of the CSS from bootstrap to material-ui for added functionality

- Button Animation
- Header Animation
- Side Drawer with all projects in it

3. Add Newest Project
4. Keep working at old projects to make them better
5.
